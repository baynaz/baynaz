## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm an **AI Engineer** deeply passionate about research, particularly in areas like NLP, deep learning, and AI interpretability.  
I love bridging the gap between theory and real-world applications: whether building research-driven models, prototyping experiments, or contributing to open source.

But that's not all — I'm also a **photographer**. Behind the algorithms, I see the world through a lens, capturing moments of light, emotion, and story.  

And yes — I grew up watching **Detective Conan**, which inspired my curiosity for puzzles, logic, and investigation. Solving problems (both in code and in life) is in my DNA.
